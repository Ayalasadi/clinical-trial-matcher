      text: `Doctor: Hi Maria, it's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit?
  
  Patient: Honestly, pretty tired. The fatigue is getting worse. And I’ve had some shortness of breath when I walk up the stairs.
  
  Doctor: Okay. Any pain?
  
  Patient: Some soreness in my chest and upper back, but it's not sharp pain. More like pressure.
  
  Doctor: Got it. I’m going to review where we are. You were diagnosed in March with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes.
  
  Doctor: And we started concurrent chemoradiation — carboplatin plus paclitaxel with radiation — and you completed that about six weeks ago, right?
  
  Patient: Yeah, finished mid-September.
  
  Doctor: Have you had any treatment since then? Immunotherapy, maintenance therapy, clinical trial enrollment, anything like that?
  
  Patient: No, not yet. You said we’d talk about next steps today.
  
  Doctor: Exactly. Before we do that, I need to confirm a few clinical details because some trials are very specific. First: how old are you?
  
  Patient: I’m 62.
  
  Doctor: And for the record, sex assigned at birth?
  
  Patient: Female.
  
  Doctor: Are you currently able to do normal daily activities like showering, cooking, light housework?
  
  Patient: Yes. I can do basic stuff around the house, I just get winded if I try to walk more than a block or carry groceries.
  
  Doctor: Okay, that sounds like an ECOG performance status of 1.
  
  Patient: Is that good or bad?
  
  Doctor: It just means you're mostly independent, which is actually good for eligibility.
  
  Patient: Okay.
  
  Doctor: Any brain mets? Have you had headaches, vision changes, weakness in an arm or leg?
  
  Patient: No, none of that.
  
  Doctor: Great. Are you currently living in Portland, Oregon still?
  
  Patient: Yes, northeast Portland.
  
  Doctor: Perfect. Location matters because some trials require in-person visits in the Pacific Northwest.
  
  Patient: I can travel to OHSU or Seattle if I have to, but probably not farther than that.
  
  Doctor: Understood. Last question: have you ever had immunotherapy, like a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor?
  
  Patient: No.
  
  Doctor: Great. So to summarize:
  - Patient is a 62-year-old female with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma subtype).
  - Completed concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel chemoradiation mid-September ~6 weeks ago.
  - No prior immunotherapy.
  - ECOG performance status approximately 1.
  - Lives in Portland, Oregon, willing to travel within Pacific Northwest.
  
  Patient: Okay. So… do I qualify for any trials?
  
  Doctor: That’s what we’re going to look at today.`

      label: "James – 71M – Recurrent prostate cancer (rising PSA)",
      text: `Doctor: Hi James, thanks for coming in. I got your labs. Your PSA has continued to rise since April.
  
  Patient: Yeah. I'm a little worried about that. I thought taking the prostate out meant we were done.
  
  Doctor: You had a prostatectomy two years ago for Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma. The margins at surgery were close but not positive. We then did short-course androgen deprivation therapy for 6 months. Does that all sound right?
  
  Patient: Yes.
  
  Doctor: Since then, have you had any radiation?
  
  Patient: No, just the hormone shots you gave me last year.
  
  Doctor: Right. So currently: you're not on hormone therapy, no radiation, and no chemotherapy so far.
  
  Patient: Correct.
  
  Doctor: Any bone pain? Hips, lower back, ribs?
  
  Patient: Some stiffness in my lower back in the morning, but it loosens up. Nothing sharp.
  
  Doctor: Any trouble urinating, blood in urine, weight loss, fevers?
  
  Patient: No blood. Peeing is slow but it's been slow for years. No fever. I did lose like 8 pounds but I've also been eating less because I'm stressed.
  
  Doctor: Understood. How's your energy? Are you mostly independent day to day?
  
  Patient: I mow the lawn, I cook, I drive myself. I get tired around 4pm but I still do everything.
  
  Doctor: I'd call that ECOG 1.
  
  Patient: Is that okay?
  
  Doctor: It usually means you're still eligible for most trials.
  
  Patient: Okay.
  
  Doctor: Just to confirm demographics for screening: you're 71 now, male, living in Salem, Oregon, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, Salem.
  
  Doctor: Do you have any interest in traveling to Portland or Seattle for trial visits if needed?
  
  Patient: Portland, sure. Seattle would be tough.
  
  Doctor: Great. Summary:
  - 71-year-old male with biochemically recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma.
  - Prior prostatectomy + short-course ADT.
  - PSA rising.
  - No prior radiation.
  - ECOG ~1.
  - Lives in Salem, OR; can travel to Portland.
  
  Patient: Do I still qualify for anything that's not full chemo?
  
  Doctor: That's exactly what I'm going to check.`

      label: "Aisha – 44F – Metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (progressed on therapy)",
      text: `Doctor: Hi Aisha. Before we talk about next-line therapy, I just want to confirm where we are. You were originally diagnosed at 41 with ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer in the left breast. Correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, that was three years ago.
  
  Doctor: You had lumpectomy, then paclitaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, then maintenance trastuzumab. You did well for a while.
  
  Patient: Right. Then last year you found spots in my liver.
  
  Doctor: Correct. At that point we called it metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. We started you on T-DXd (trastuzumab deruxtecan). You stayed pretty stable on that for about 9 months.
  
  Patient: And now it's growing again?
  
  Doctor: The most recent CT shows mild progression in the liver lesions, yes.
  
  Patient: Okay.
  
  Doctor: Any neurologic symptoms? Headaches, vision changes, balance problems?
  
  Patient: No. No headaches, no dizzy spells.
  
  Doctor: Any shortness of breath?
  
  Patient: Only when I walk uphill fast. Day-to-day I'm okay, I can work, take care of my kids.
  
  Doctor: I'd call that ECOG 1.
  
  Patient: Is that good?
  
  Doctor: It means you're still active and mostly independent, which keeps trial options open.
  
  Patient: Okay.
  
  Doctor: You're 44 now, female, still living in Seattle, Washington?
  
  Patient: Yes.
  
  Doctor: Would you be open to traveling to California sites or would you prefer to stay in the Pacific Northwest?
  
  Patient: I'd really prefer to stay close. Maybe Portland or Seattle.
  
  Doctor: Got it. Summary:
  - 44-year-old female with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
  - Prior HER2-directed therapy including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DXd.
  - Mild liver progression on current line.
  - ECOG ~1.
  - Lives in Seattle, WA; willing to travel within Pacific Northwest.
  
  Patient: Do I have any non-chemo trials left?
  
  Doctor: That's exactly what I'm going to check next.`
